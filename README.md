ΤΟ 'ΕΝ 'ΑΡΧΗ: OR, An Exercitation UPON A MOMENTOUS QUESTION IN Divinity, and Caſe of Conſcience:VIZ.
1. TO THE Chriſtian and Proteſtant READER.

#####Body#####

1. Whether it be lawful to act contrary to an Opining Conſcience?

    _ CHAP. I. The Queſtion ſhortly ſtated. The terms [Conſcience,] and [Opining] opened: The Various complexions of Conſcience; ariſing from the different mediums by which light ſhines into a ſoul about a Practical Propoſition. The terms of Faith, Science, Opinion, Doubting, Suſpition, Scruple, opened. The true notion of a Fixed Conſcience, an Opining Conſcience, a doubting, and a Scruputons Conſcience. The Schoolmens Notion of an Opinion. The Queſtion fully ſtated. The method propounded for handling it.

    _ CHAP. II. The Opinions of Popiſh School-men, and Caſuiſts in the Caſe particularly of Vaſquez, Sanchez Medina, Filiucius, Azorius. Their Monſtrous Aſſertions, what they make neceſſary to make an Opinion probable. The Opinion of one Doctor according to them ſufficient to warrant Men to Act contrary to their own Opinions. Their Opinions what a Man ought to do, when Superiours Command Inferiours, what the Inferiours judge unlawful. The ſumme of their deteſtable Doctrine.

    _ CHAP. III. The Opinion of former Proteſtants, about the lawfulneſs, or unlawfulneſs of Mens Acting contrary to the Opinion of their own Conſciences. Such Acting condemned by all former Proteſtant Caſuiſts. Baldvinus, Alſtedius, Ameſius, Perkins: The difference of ſome later Divines from their Fore-Fathers, particularly, Mr. Hooker. The Vanity of his Proof, from Deut. 17.18. Acts 15. Or from Reaſon. Biſhop Sanderſon agreeing with Ancient Proteſtants. So Mr. Fulwood, in his Caſes. The differing Expreſſions of ſome Divines of this preſent Age, The tender touching of the Queſtion, and nibbling at the Opinion of the Popiſh Doctors in the Caſe by others. The Queſtion again ſtated, and made ready for Debate.

    _ CHAP. IV. The Queſtion ſtated; It is proved, that it is not Lawful to Act contrary to the Opinion of a Mans particular Conſcience, by five Arguments; becauſe the particular Conſcience is the Proximate Rule of Action, granted by all Divines. Becauſe of that Text, Rom. 14.23. Becauſe it Subjects a Man to continual Terrors of Conſcience. The contrary Principle over-throws the Natural Order of the Souls Operation, and plucks up a great Pillar of the Proteſtant Religion, and would make the Scriptures and Argumentative Books of little Ʋſe but to Torment Men.

    _ CHAP. V. The Grand Objection anſwered. This Principle doth not take away all Power from Magiſtrates, nor at all diſſolve the Bonds of any due Obedience. The Magiſtrates Power opened, granted, limited; he hath no power to Judge as to the Inferiours practice, what is, or is not indifferent. The ſtrange variety of conformable Writers, in ſtating, and determining the Queſtion. The Reaſonableneſs, and Neceſſity of Indulgence. Dr. Aſhton's late Book examined, his Notion of Perſecution inquired into, the true Notion of it. An Introduction to the next Caſe.

    _ CHAP. VI. Second Queſt. Whether it be Naturally poſſible for any Perſon in a Practical Propoſition to judge that part probably Lawful from extrinſick. Arguments; the contrary to which he at the ſame time Judgeth probably unlawful from intrinſick Arguments. The Queſtion opened. The Opinions of Vaſquez, Sanchez. The Negative part of the Queſtion maintained, becauſe this is contrary to the Principles of a Rational Soul. The Concluſion.
